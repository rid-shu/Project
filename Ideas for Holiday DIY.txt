11. Tissue Holder:
Cut one (from the outside fabric) 6? x 7?
Cut one (from the lining fabric) 6-3/4? x 7?.
You will notice that the lining fabric is 1/4? shorter than the outside fabric.
The reason I do this is so that after is is sewn and is turned right side out, the lining is a tiny bit smaller.
